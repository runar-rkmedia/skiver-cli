### Configuration

Configuration-files can be used in various formats, including `yml`, `toml` and `json`.

A benefit of using `toml` here is that it can be generated with comments included.

The file should be named `skiver-cli.toml` (change the extension to fit your preferred format).

The can store the file in your home-directory/config-directory, or in the current path, which is what you want in most cases when working with projects.

An initial file can be generated with:

```shell-script
skiver config new
```
